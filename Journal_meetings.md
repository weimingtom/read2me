#This page will present an overall summary of all the decision we took and all the ideas we thought about during the meetings.

# 2/1/07 Meeting with Diane #
We talked about the amount of text that the user would be allowed to copy to Read2me.

How are we gonna handle the navigation in the text.
What do we consider as a paragraph end marker?
What do we consider as a sentence end marker? ?!.;:/""
It may take more time than what we thought.

Read2Me will need to prompt the user to save his settings, if they have been changed (volume, reading speed, voice,etc) before exiting the program.

Need to update the project schedule since we forgot springbreak.

Need to update the specs and specify that the project should be multi-platform.
